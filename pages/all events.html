               <p>Accuracy is as important as speed when it comes to line follower robots. Following a single line with
                  a few curves and loops seems to be an easy job but not every robot stands up to the constraints that a
                  single line imposes. The discipline of your automatons are set to be tested when they enter the
                  tracker arena on 3th-5th March with hundreds of others that will race against time to bustle from
                  start to finish in the minimum possible time. A perfect blend of speed and accuracy is the demand of
                  the hour.
